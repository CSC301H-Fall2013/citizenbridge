----
A platform for communicating with your representative. 

8 volunteers 
Create relation ship between citizens and representatives
 - Citizens talk to reps and reps talk to citizen
 - online town halls 
 - explain why their bills were created. 

built on a transparent platform 
 - asks:
 		- Real Name
 		- Email address 
 		- Post Code 

 User 	
 	- see 3 levels 
 		- federal   			<-federal level 
 		- provincial	
 		- municipal (?) 

 Current problem 
  - existing site is very complex to use. Things hidden away under a complex structure. 


Stages 
 	1- pre-planning. 			
 	2- Spoken on the house of comments,   <<reporters pick up on this. 

users:
 - focus on users who are already engaged
 - sporadically engadegd, with specific intrests  (specific bill)  (only for their intrest)
 			- don't care about rep, don't care about foreign policy 

 intrests
  - Time Line: track bill progress. Graph that shows it's progress. (date stamps)
  - Time line: passes though 1 day, 1 week, often longer. Push though in winter break. 

  Bill Examples 
  	- change laws
  	- change copy right laws  
  	- change licensing 
  	- budget bills (1 -2 paragraphs)

 Privacy 
  - User data base is not made public. 


User Cases:
  - When I come back to the site, I would like to be notified about : Billl, comments, reps spoke in house of comments 

  		test caes:
  			- Does the user see a circle 

  - Log in is not required. "I want to see data without having to give data"

  - voting 
  - following
  - notifications of 
  - commitee work, (usually hidden, not visible): see what commitee are doing, and what products they generate. 
  		Official Commitee reports. 
  		Unofficial reports (often not shown) <- users want to see.. 
  	 ^- Want to contribute to those reports.  Uber user, 
  	  - know who is on which commitee 
  - users want to reach the commitee, because rep is only 1 vote. 
  - How would rep use it: 
   	- find out what citizens are intrested in 

  - users: 
  	 	- know when their reps are in town. (rep in ottowa or missasagua)
  	 	- see the calendar of the rep .
  	 	- tool to create meetings between reps and citizens 



Understanding 
 1) House of commers, elected 
 2) House  Sanitor, appointed

not a voting place, but pure information. Not a flaming war place. 
Site is neutral, not biasaed thoward one party or the other. Avoid "propoganda tool thing"


Tech 
php, codeignitor, use a bit of Bootstrap 
check: WET web experience toolkit . 
 • Info needs to be very accessible 
 • Eventually bi-lingual
